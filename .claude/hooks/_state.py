"""Shared state-discovery helpers for session-continuity hooks.

Pure-Python module — no Claude Code SDK calls, no network I/O.
Used by `spec_orient.py`, `compact_warning.py`, and the
`/handoff` slash command.

Three responsibilities:

1. ``discover_specs(roots)`` — walk every ``specs/`` directory
   under ``roots`` for in-flight specs, returns most-recently
   modified first.
2. ``git_state(cwd)`` — branch + last commit + uncommitted file
   list. Tolerates missing git or non-repo paths.
3. ``session_sentinel_path(session_id)`` — the once-per-session
   file used by ``compact_warning.py`` so the warning fires
   exactly once.
