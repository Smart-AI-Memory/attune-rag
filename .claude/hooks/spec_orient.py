"""SessionStart spec-orientation hook.

Fires on every SessionStart event. Branches on the ``source``
field (verified 2026-05-09 to be one of ``startup``, ``resume``,
``clear``, or ``compact``):

- ``compact`` → emit the most-recent in-flight spec's tasks.md
  (or design / requirements as a fallback) so the model has the
  spec body in fresh post-compact context. Replaces the original
  PreCompact-injection design (V2 found PreCompact has no
  content-injection mechanism).
- everything else → emit a short orientation paragraph naming up
  to 3 in-flight specs.

Output goes to stdout; Claude Code splices it into the model's
initial context. The hook is wrapped in try/except so a crash
never breaks the user's session.
