"""Model tier resolution — the canonical (and only) copy of the attune tier contract.

Three tiers map to three model IDs, each overridable via an environment
variable. attune-ai imports this module directly (``attune.model_tiers``
is a thin re-export; attune-rag is a core dependency there). The earlier
byte-for-byte mirrors in attune-author and attune-ai are retired —
attune-author is archived, and attune-ai's mirror was removed once its
"installs standalone" premise proved false (attune-rag has been core
there since 2026-04-30). Change tier defaults here and only here.

Resolution is per-call (``os.getenv`` on every ``resolve_model``), not
import-time, so tests can flip tiers with ``monkeypatch.setenv`` and CI
pins take effect without re-import ordering concerns — same pattern as
``_cache_control()`` in ``providers/claude.py``.

Stdlib only (logging, not structlog): consumers import this on their
lightest paths (config loading, agent factories) and must not pull
structlog, anthropic, or any I/O just to resolve a model ID.
